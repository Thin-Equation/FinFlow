### Key Relationships

1. **FinancialEntity to Document**:
   - One entity can have many documents (one-to-many)
   - Entities can be vendors, customers, employees, etc.
   - Documents reference the entity that issued them and the recipient entity

2. **Document to LineItem**:
   - One document can have many line items (one-to-many)
   - Line items belong to exactly one document

3. **Document to Document**:
   - Documents can be related to other documents (many-to-many)
   - Relationships include: invoice→receipt, purchase order→invoice, etc.
   - Tracked through the DocumentRelationship model

4. **ComplianceRule to Document**:
   - Compliance rules apply to specific document types
   - Documents are validated against applicable rules
   - Results are stored in ValidationResult objects

## Validation Requirements

### Document Validation

1. **Basic Field Validation**:
   - Required fields must be present (document number, date, etc.)
   - Numerical fields must be within valid ranges
   - Dates must be properly formatted and logical (e.g., issue date before due date)

2. **Financial Validation**:
   - Total amount must equal sum of line items plus tax
   - Tax calculations must be correct based on tax rates
   - Line item calculations (quantity × price = total) must be accurate

3. **Entity Validation**:
   - Issuer and recipient information must be complete
   - Tax IDs must be in correct format based on country

### Compliance Validation

1. **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - Documents must adhere to jurisdictional requirements
   - Tax rates must be appropriate for the transaction type and location
   - Required disclosures must be present

2. **Internal Policy Compliance**:
   - Documents must follow company approval workflows
   - Expense limits must be respected
   - Required supporting documentation must be attached

3. **Fraud Prevention**:
   - Duplicate detection to prevent double payments
   - Unusual transaction detection
   - Vendor verification

## Data Lifecycle

1. **Document Creation**:
   - Documents are created via document upload or manual entry
   - Initial parsing is done by Document AI
   - Extracted data is validated against the document schema

2. **Document Processing**:
   - Documents undergo compliance checks
   - Documents are categorized and classified
   - Relationships with other documents are established

3. **Document Approval/Workflow**:
   - Documents follow approval workflows based on type and amount
   - Status is updated throughout the process

4. **Document Storage**:
   - Documents are stored with metadata for retrieval
   - Documents are linked to entities and other documents
   - Audit trail is maintained for all changes
