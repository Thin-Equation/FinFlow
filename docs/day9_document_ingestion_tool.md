# Document Ingestion Tool Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Document Ingestion Tool for FinFlow, completed on Day 9 (May 16, 2025) according to the project roadmap.

## Components Implemented

1. **Document Validation**
   - File type checking (PDF, images)
   - File size verification
   - Format-specific validation for PDFs and images
   - Comprehensive error handling

2. **Document Preprocessing**
   - PDF optimization
   - Image format conversion and optimization
   - Creation of processed copies for Document AI
   - Standardized preprocessing workflow

3. **Document Upload**
   - Single document upload with validation
   - Batch document upload capability
   - File organization and timestamping
   - Detailed status reporting

4. **Integration**
   - Integration with Document Processor Agent
   - Support for various document formats (PDFs, JPEGs, PNGs)
   - Error handling for invalid documents

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite:
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for the full workflow
- Sample document generation for testing

## Dependencies

Added the following dependencies to requirements.txt:
- python-magic: For file type detection
- Pillow: For image processing
- PyMuPDF: For PDF validation and handling
- PyPDF2: For additional PDF testing functionality

## Usage Example

```python
from tools.document_ingestion import validate_document, preprocess_document, upload_document

# Validate a document
result = validate_document('/path/to/invoice.pdf')
if result['valid']:
    print("Document is valid:", result['message'])
    
    # Preprocess the document
    prep_result = preprocess_document('/path/to/invoice.pdf')
    if prep_result['status'] == 'success':
        print("Document preprocessed:", prep_result['processed_file_path'])
        
        # Upload the document
        upload_result = upload_document('/path/to/invoice.pdf')
        print("Upload status:", upload_result['status'])
```

## Next Steps

1. Integrate with Document AI processing
2. Add additional validation rules for specific invoice types
3. Implement advanced preprocessing techniques for improved extraction accuracy

## Conclusion

The Document Ingestion Tool provides a robust foundation for document processing in the FinFlow system. It successfully handles document validation, preprocessing, and storage, enabling reliable document processing workflows.
