# FinFlow Agent Testing Documentation

## Initial Agent Behavior and Capabilities

*Document Date: May 18, 2023*

This document outlines the initial behavior and capabilities of the FinFlow agent system, focusing on the basic test agent functionality established during Day 6 of the development roadmap.

## 1. Basic Agent Capabilities

### HelloWorldAgent

The `HelloWorldAgent` is a simple test agent that demonstrates the core functionality of the ADK (Agent Development Kit) integration. It has the following capabilities:

- Responds to greetings with a predefined message
- Explains its purpose when asked
- Provides basic error handling for unsupported operations
- Maintains session state between interactions

### Basic Session State Management

All agents in the FinFlow system inherit from the `BaseAgent` class, which provides:

- Session state persistence between agent invocations
- Ability to store and retrieve data from the context object
- Structured logging with tracing context

## 2. Testing Infrastructure

The following testing components have been implemented:

### Unit Tests

- `test_hello_world_agent.py`: Verifies basic agent interaction and responses
- `test_agent_initialization.py`: Tests agent initialization with different configurations
- `test_base_agent.py`: Ensures the base functionality works correctly

### Local Testing with ADK CLI

- Running `./run_hello_world.sh` starts a local instance of the Hello World agent
- The agent runs on port 8080 by default
- Interactive testing available through the ADK CLI interface

## 3. Agent Implementation Notes

### Agent Creation Process

To create a new agent in the FinFlow system:

1. Create a new class inheriting from `BaseAgent`
2. Initialize with name, model, description, and instructions
3. Add any specialized tools the agent needs
4. Implement custom behavior as needed

### Configuration Management

- Agents can be configured through YAML files in the `config/` directory
- Environment-specific configurations available (development, staging, production)
- Agent parameters (model, temperature, etc.) can be customized per environment

## 4. Current Limitations

- Limited error handling for complex scenarios
- No advanced tool integrations yet
- Simple prompt engineering without complex reasoning chains
- No document processing capabilities implemented yet

## 5. Next Steps

- Implement specialized tools for financial document processing
- Add rule retrieval and validation capabilities
- Integrate with document storage and retrieval systems
- Implement more complex agent interactions

## 6. Running Tests

To run the basic agent tests:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source ./finflow-env/bin/activate

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_hello_world_agent.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=agents tests/
```

To run the Hello World agent with the ADK CLI:

```bash
# Start the agent on default port (8080)
./run_hello_world.sh

# Start with a custom port
./run_hello_world.sh --port 8081

# Start in debug mode
./run_hello_world.sh --debug
```
