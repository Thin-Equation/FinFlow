# Day 8: Document AI Setup for Invoice Parsing

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Created Document AI Processor for Invoice Parsing
- Implemented invoice processor setup using Google Cloud Document AI
- Added processor configuration in `tools/document_ai.py`
- Created `setup_invoice_processor.sh` script for automated setup

### 2. Added Training Functionality for the Processor
- Implemented functions for training the Document AI processor
- Added support for importing training documents
- Provided mechanism to train processor with sample invoice documents

### 3. Implemented Testing and Validation
- Created `test_invoice_processor.py` script for testing
- Implemented `evaluate_processor_performance()` function for processor evaluation
- Added functionality to test with validation dataset

### 4. Documented Processor Capabilities and Limitations
- Created detailed documentation in `docs/document_ai_invoice_processor.md`
- Documented supported fields, formats, and features
- Outlined known limitations and best practices

### 5. Integrated with DocumentProcessorAgent
- Updated the DocumentProcessorAgent to use the invoice processor
- Created specialized `InvoiceProcessingTool` in `utils/agent_tools.py`
- Added dual-tool approach with general document processing and specialized invoice processing

### 6. Sample Invoice Generation
- Created `generate_sample_invoices.py` utility
- Implemented automatic generation of realistic sample invoices
- Added configurations for training and validation datasets

## Next Steps
1. Collect and annotate real invoice samples
2. Fine-tune the processor with domain-specific invoices
3. Integrate with financial reporting and accounts payable processes
4. Add support for additional document types beyond invoices
